            <p>Many say how one town is so different from the neighboring town in this country. Italy provides a wide
                variety of food and culture. Rather than being a whole nation, Italy is more like a country of collected
                cultural points. </p>
            <p>No one actually knows where italy got it's name. Also, it does not have a national fruit, as it has a
                little bit of everything like fruits and berries.</p>
            <p>Most Italians start their day off with coffee and the children drink hot chocolate or hot milk in the
                mornings. Some put alcohol in their coffee as well.</p>
