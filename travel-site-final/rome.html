                <h2>Rome</h2>
                <p>Rome is the capital city and a special comune of Italy as well as the capital of the Lazio region.
                </p>
                <p>Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles
                    (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.</p>

            <h2>Points of Interest</h2>
            <p>Rome is known for its stunning architecture, with the Colleseum, Pantheon, and Trevi Fountain as the main
                attractions.</p>
            <p>Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the
                site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in
                Europe.</p>
            <img src="rome.jpeg" alt="Rome" id="Rome">
            <p>Rome is 4292 miles from New York, and the area inside the boundary of Rome is 1,285 km2, or 496.1 sq
                miles. The area of New York City is 468.9 square miles.</p>
            <p>The Roman Empire was one of the greatest and most influential civilisations in the world and lasted for
                over a 1000 years.</p>
            <p>In 476 C.E. Romulus, the last of the Roman emperors in the west, was overthrown by the Germanic leader
                Odoacer, who became the first Barbarian to rule in Rome. The order that the Roman Empire had brought to
                western Europe for 1000 years was no more.</p>
