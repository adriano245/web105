    <h1>MAFIA II</h1>

    <h2>2K Czech/ 2K Games</h2>
    <h3>Review of the game</h3>

    <p>(DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS) Mafia 2 is an action-adventure game developed by 2K Czech and produced by 2K Games in
        2010.
        You play as Vito Scaletta, a Sicilian immigrant who moved to America in the 1920’s who meets a boy named Joe
        Barbaro who he fought for a place in his gang.
        Later, in the 1940’s, Joe and Vito went on little crime sprees as there wasn’t much work around and needed to
        make money. Vito ends up getting arrested and goes to war instead of going to jail.
        Upon coming back home on forged discharge papers provided from Joe and his connections, Vito gets back into the
        crime scene with Joe. </p>

    <p>Vito and Joe get in tight with the Carlo Falcone Crime Family, and go as far as becoming made men, a position
        reserved only for Sicilian gang members.
        They later get rid of the other crime bosses leaving Falcone, who they have no choice but to kill because
        that
        is their only way of surviving, all because they wanted to avenge their friend who ended up being an
        informant
        for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, which set up an unfortunate chain of events for the two.</p>

    <p>While Mafia 2 is categorized as an action-adventure game, it is much more than that.
        It shows many aspects of how life really was being a mafioso in the 40-50's, it does include the action, but
        also shows the sadness and heartbreak through Vito’s life.
        In the cutscene before the final mission, Vito looks through the photo album that he was looking at in the
        beginning of the game.
        However, instead of reminiscing like he was in the beginning of the game, he explains how terrible things
        have
        gotten for him, saying <q>This wasn’t how I imagined it when I was starting out. I dreamed of money, cars,
            women, respect, freedom... I guess I ended up getting all of that more or less, but along with it came
            prison, living in constant fear, and the blood of my friends. I ducked it as long as I could, but it was
            finally catching up to me. It was all just a matter of time...</q></p>

    <p>The game is an emotional rollercoaster, with one part having wisecracks between Vito and Joe, and the next
        showing Joe’s childhood friend getting shot, waiting for the two to return.
        The game really is something to be played, and I recommend it to everybody looking for something new to
        play.
    </p>

    <h3>Other games in the series</h3>
    <p>Mafia, the precursor to Mafia 2, is a completely different story that only has a reference in Mafia 2 because
        of
        the ending.
        Mafia 3 is a different story from Mafia 2, but does contain Vito as a recuring character.
