                    <p>In 2004, Honda produced a stroked 90.7 mm (3.57 in) version of the F20C, increasing displacement
                        by 160 cc (9.8 cu in)
                        to 2.2 L; 131.6 cu in (2,157 cc). Dubbed the F22C1, it was originally designed for the North
                        American market being
                        introduced for the 2004 model year. Maximum power output was maintained at 240 hp (179 kW; 243
                        PS) at 7,800 rpm. Rated
                        torque increased from 155 lb⋅ft (210 N⋅m) at 7,500 rpm for the F20C to 162 lb⋅ft (220 N⋅m) at
                        6,500 rpm for the F22C.
                        The redline was reduced from 8,900 rpm to 8,200 rpm, mandated by the longer travel distance of
                        the pistons. Peak
                        horsepower output was originally rated identical to the F20C, with "overall powerband
                        characteristics strengthened 4% to
                        10% between 1,000 -8,000 rpm".</p>
                    <p>The F22C1 was used exclusively in the North American market for 2004 and 2005 with the F20C being
                        used in all other
                        markets. In 2006, the engine fully replaced F20C engines in the Japanese market as well which
                        resulted in a drop in
                        rated power output from 250 PS (184 kW; 247 bhp) to 242 PS (178 kW; 239 bhp). Outside Japan and
                        the United States, the
                        F20C continued to be the only available engine.</p>
